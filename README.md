This project is made with Unreal Engine version 5.6.0, and all the features are made only using C++.

BoxSpawner: 
  - Box Spawner will load A JSON file containing box types and objects data. 
  - Randomly select a type and transform data.
  - Spawns a box with selected parameters. 

Box: 
  - The box will contain data like name, health, and score.
  - On a projectile hit, it will take 1 damage. 
  - If health reaches zero, it destroys itself and notifies the UI with its score and type 

Player Character: 
  - On fire input (mouse left click) spawns a projectile at the rifleâ€™s muzzle location. 

Projectile: 
  - Uses Unreal's projectile system to travel.
  - On collision with the box, it will deal 1 damage to the box.

UserWidget: 
 - Updates and displays the total score.
 - Additionally, it will display the last destroyed box type.

Challenges:
 - One of the trickiest parts was to load and fetch data from a JSON file. And as suggested, I took help from the internet.
 - The other tricky part was detecting a collision. Because the  box does not have physics, the projectile was not detecting the collision with the box. But it was a simple fix.

To test the feature, just play it on the editor. The player character will be equipped with a rifle, and the first box will spawn automatically. Mouse left click to fire. As soon as the box is destroyed, another will spawn, and the score will update.
